Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) is a kernel-based, complexity-penalized method developed by [Hainmueller and Hazlett (2013)](http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/2/143), and designed to minimize parametric assumptions while maintaining interpretive clarity. Here, we introduce *bigKRLS*, an updated version of the original [KRLS R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KRLS) with algorithmic and implementation improvements designed to optimize speed and memory usage. These improvements allow users to straightforwardly estimate pairwise regression models with KRLS once N > ~2500. *bigKRLS* is now available on CRAN:

# Major Updates

1. C++ integration. We re-implement most major computations in the model in C++ via [Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) and [RcppArmadillo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo). These changes produce up to a 50% runtime decrease compared to the original R implementation.

2. Leaner algorithm. Because of the Tikhonov regularization and parameter tuning strategies used in KRLS, the method of estimation is inherently memory-heavy (O(N<sup>2</sup>)), making memory savings important even in small- and medium-sized applications. We develop and implement a [new marginal effects algorithm](https://github.com/rdrr1990/code/blob/master/mohanty_shaffer_IMC.pdf), which reduces peak memory usage by approximately an order of magnitude, and cut the number of computations needed to find regularization parameter [in half](https://github.com/rdrr1990/code/blob/master/solveforc.pdf).

3. Improved memory management. Most data objects in R perform poorly in memory-intensive applications. We use a series of packages in the [bigmemory](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bigmemory) environment to ease this constraint, allowing our implementation to handle larger datasets more smoothly.

4. Parallel Processing. Parallel processing with [parallel](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf) makes the algorithm much faster for the marginal effects.

5. Interactive data visualization. We've designed an R [Shiny](shiny.rstudio.com) app that allows users bigKRLS users to easily share results with collaborators or more general audiences. Simply call shiny.bigKRLS() on the outputted regression object.

# New on GitHub Version

1. Honest p values. `bigKRLS` now computes p values that reflect both the regularization process and the number of predictors. For details and other options, see `help(summary.bigKRLS)`.

```
out <- bigKRLS(y, X)
summary(out)
```

2. Cross-validation, including K folds crossvalidation. `crossvalidate.bigKRLS` performs CV, stores a number of in and out of sample statistics, as well as metadata documenting how the were split, the bigmemory file structure (if appropriate), and so on. See `vignette("bigKRLS_basics")` for syntax.


# Installation
bigKRLS is under active development. bigKRLS requires R version 3.3.0 or later. Windows users should use RTools 3.3 or later. To use RStudio, Windows must use RStudio 1.1.129 or newer. To install the latest stable version from CRAN:
```
install.packages("bigKRLS")
```

To instead install the newest version from GitHub, use standard devtools syntax:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('rdrr1990/bigKRLS')
```

## Dependencies
bigKRLS requires Rcpp and RcppArmadillo, as well as a series of packages in the bigmemory environment. Users new to these packages may wish see our [installation notes](https://github.com/rdrr1990/code/blob/master/bigKRLS_installation.md).

# Getting Going...
For details on syntax, load the library and then open our vignette:
```
library(bigKRLS)
vignette("bigKRLS_basics")
```
Because of the quadratic memory requirement, users working on a typical laptop (8-16 gigabytes of RAM) may wish to start at N = 2,500 or 5,000, particularly if the number of *x* variables is large. When you have a sense of how bigKRLS runs on your system, you may wish to only estimate a subset of the marginal effects at N = 10-15,000 by setting bigKRLS(... which.derivatives = c(1, 3, 5)) for the marginal effects of the first, third, and fifth *x* variable.
